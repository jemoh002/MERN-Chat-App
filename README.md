This is a Chat app created using MERN STACK:
Chakra-ui has also been created for the frontend

The app persistently stores messages in the db and also shows notifications for user messages.
It does not persistently store notifications.
Some of the exciting dependencies:
bcryptjs
jsonwebtoken
socket.io

Some react apps like lottie and react-notification-badge also make the app enticing.

Bon Appetit!
